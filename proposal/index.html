                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3><q>A brief description of the project.</q></h3>
                <p>The project will be Chess against the Stockfish chess engine.</p>
                <p>It will also feature board analysis from Lichess.</p>

                <h3><q>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</q></h3>
                <p>There is not really an "problem" I am solving. It's just Chess against a robot.</p>

                <h3><q>What is your motivation to work on this?</q></h3>
                <p>I have been a fan of Chess for a long time, (though I am not particularly good at it).</p>
                <p>For every final project I have had thus far, I wished I had been able to do Chess, and this time I believe that I can pull it off.</p>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <h3><q>Who is the target audience for the application? Who will it serve?</q></h3>
                <p>It is targeted at people that want to play Chess, and more specifically people that want to get better at it.</p>

                <h2>Major Functions</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>setupBoard()</dt>
                    <dd>Builds the game board and places all pieces in their proper starting positions.</dd>

                    <dt>getAiMove()</dt>
                    <dd>Fetches the API response on where the opponent should move. Sends the current board state using FEN notation.</dd>

                    <dt>getBoardAnalysis()</dt>
                    <dd>Fetches board analysis API response from Lichess.</dd>

                    <dt>buildFenString()</dt>
                    <dd>Takes the current board state and converts it into a valid FEN string to send to the APIs.</dd>

                    <dt>clickSpace()</dt>
                    <dd>Called when a space is clicked. Gathers information to send to other functions, such as: which space was clicked, what piece is in it, what color the piece is, and whether the piece has moved (important for pawns, rooks, and kings).</dd>

                    <dt>showMoves()</dt>
                    <dd>Highlights valid spaces to move to, including when kings are in check, and does nothing if there are no valid moves from said space.</dd>

                    <dt>[pawn|knight|bishop|queen|king]Move()</dt>
                    <dd>Called by showMoves. Gets valid moves for the piece type given the current board state.</dd>

                    <dt>makeMove()</dt>
                    <dd>Actually makes the move happen. Updates where the selected piece is located and captures pieces as needed.</dd>

                    <dt>updateHistory()</dt>
                    <dd>Adds new lines to the move history display by calling buildFenString.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h2>External Data</h2>
                <h3><q>What external API data source(s) will you use?</q></h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>chess-api.com/</dt>
                    <dd>Chess engine for opponent</dd>

                    <dt>lichess.org/api</dt>
                    <dd>Board analysis for player</dd>
                </dl>

                <h3><q>What data will you need to store?</q></h3>
                <p>I believe it would be reasonable to store the current game in progress in localStorage. Chess games can go on for a while, and it would be most unfortunate if someone were to loose power and need to start over.</p>

                    <li><code>Piece.mjs</code> - would be a piece class holding all the relevant data for said piece</li>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <h3><q>What do you anticipate being the biggest challenges in building this application?</q></h3>
                <p>Scope creep. I am constantly struggling with it in all my projects. Things like "Wouldn't it be cool if...", "I should add...", "And it could..." are the bane of my existence and I expect I will have MANY issues with them in a project I am so invested in.</p>
